# Portfolio
Hi there!
Welcome to my Portfolio!
Before you go through my work and my scripts, I would just like for you guys to acknowledge some stuff for me üôÇ

Firstly, all the work you see in ‚ÄúPortfolio - 2023.ZiP‚Äù is work for University projects at SAE Institute. This was within my first year of SAE, my second year being about Unreal Engine and learning Blueprinting. 
Within this folder, you will see 5 Unity Projects. The first project is: BoxyGameFinal.zip‚Äù and the last project is: Evergreen Reserve.
Personally, my proudest game within all of these was VirusTown as it allowed me to explore more of Unity and environmental design. I can guarantee there are bugs in every single project in this portfolio but I feel really proud about the work I‚Äôve done so far and feel as though I show potential to grow as a person and developer in the future and would love for you guys to be able to find space for me to support this and help a young student grow.

Secondly and Finally, I included a bit of work I did called ‚ÄúA Text Adventure Game‚Äù. It‚Äôs not the most advanced thing in the world, nor is it Unity, but I spent many hours sitting writing the script. It never got completed due to University but I‚Äôm proud of the work I put into it. It has just the Easy mode and I believe it has all options completed so you are free to explore the different stories within each option.

Sorry for such a big paragraph but I hope you enjoy the rest of my portfolio and consider me for the position, or even consider me for Work Experience and support a young student grow into the industry and expand my potential more than ever!
